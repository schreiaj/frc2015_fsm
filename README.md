## Using FSMs to Model Game Activities

Today, we're going to build a simple FSM to model the FRC2015 game, Recycle Rush. I'm going to focus on the part of the game I know, so we're going to build a FSM for a HP loaded stacker. I'm also going to introduce the concept of multiple possible transitions from a single state.

### The State Machine
Last time I wrote out all the states and transitions, today I'm going to skip that and provide a simple diagram. You'll notice it's a fair bit more complicated than before.
